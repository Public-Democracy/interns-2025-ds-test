They are not saying that the Jesus-passages in some late texts of the B.Tal don't relate to the Jesus of medieval Christianity. At the moment that article represents a glaring POV with no single academic source in the article refs supporting the stance of the lede that the name may refer to another \""individual\"" called Jesus.","2025-07-15 13:21:00"

(btw in case you missed it, Meier is following Maier's reading of \""later rabbinical writing\"" to include what Maier believed were later interpolations to the Talmud, it doesn't mean that Meier disagrees with Maier and thinks that the Yeshu passages are original.

Also, protecting a page to due to a TV program when little vandalism has occured is pre-emptive.

On the other hand individual nominations will make a mess of AfD. I am not even considering prod since I suspect that one used will simply remove the tags.

I will add more as I find them. Articles - Walker River Basin, Little Smoky-Newark Watershed, Hot Creek-Railroad Watershed, Dry Creek Watershed, Searchlight Triple Divide Point. Categories - Lahontan regions, Oregon closed basin, Humboldt River Basin, Great Salt Lake regions, Tulare-Buena Vista region, Northern Mojave-Mono Lake region, Central Nevada Desert Basins, Sevier Basin, Black Rock region, Carson River Basin, Honey-Eagle Watershed, Truckee basin, Great Basin section, Ivanpah-Pahrump Watershed, Mono-Owens region, Categories named after valleys, Lower Colorado-Lake Mead\u2026","2024-11-10 01:43:00"

"72","8","assistant","Another point, I made at one of the CfD entries, but erased because it didn't actually apply to those categories--if categories or articles are specifically defined to be USGS hydrologic units, as many of these are, shouldn't they be named properly, with terms as used in the USGS system? Example: says \""The Truckee basin (USGS HUC 18100200)\""--but an 8-digit HUC is a \""subbasin\"" not a \""basin\"" in the system. Similarly, the \""Hot Creek-Railroad Watershed\"" page seems to be about a \""subbasin\"", not a \""watershed\"", as those terms are used in the USGS system (\""The Hot Creek-Railroad Watershed (USGS Huc 16060009)\""). I've tried to explain the system a bit at , though it could be much expanded. Maybe this is too nitpicky, but I've been confused about how the USGS hierarchy is being remade into categories here, and the lack of consistent naming just adds to my confusion.","2024-11-11 05:39:00"

There are, nevertheless, exceptions which deserve special treatment, especially in the area of art (including painting, sculpture and artistic photography) where the image is an extremely important part of the article. Like many other seasoned Wikipedians working in this area, I firmly believe it is useful to define larger image sizes in certain cases so that the reader can immediately appreciate the detail without having to bother about standard settings or clicking on the image to enlarge it. You can find thousands of examples but just take a look at . I think you will agree that if all the images in this article were reduced to standard thumbs, most readers would have a less vivid impression of the article's content. Some other examples in photography are , and . And as for general guidance, in the WP Manual of Style, you will see that there is provision in the for resizing images where appropriate.

In most cases the people that do the checkuser will only do so if the sock has been used to circumvent a ban\/block, 3RR, or to change the outcome of a consensus discussion. So if you have reason to believe that Bigglove is a sock of Isarig, it is generally acceptable to request that a checkuser be run since Bigglove was in use during Isarig's block. However if the belief is that Bigglove is a sock of Qaiqu, you're pretty much out of luck as Qaiqu is currently not blocked\/banned and there isn't any overlap between their editing periods to indicate an attempt to circumvent 3RR or change the results of a consensus discussion. Another reason you're out of luck with using Checkuser on Qaiqu is the age of the user's last edit. I'm not sure exactly how long the information used for checkuser is kept, but from what I've seen any time an editor's last edit is over a month or two prior to the current date, it can not be run. --","2021-08-25 18:36:00"

While I'm not sure about the importance of the barony in which an Irish town lies (does anybody living there care or even know more than a hundred years after their abolishment?), in any case a secondary source would be better than just a footnote that isn't really verifiable by the average reader. Do you know where to find one?","2024-02-26 21:48:00"
"118","2","assistant","I agree. They are being given entirely too much prominence in marginally related articles, as I have already pointed out here. Laurel Lodged proposed developing dedicated articles on the Baronies of Ireland, which seems to me a more constructive approach. They are no longer of sufficient importance as to appear in article leads on towns and villages. My attempts to suggest as much earlier have been largely ignored.","2024-02-26 23:37:00"
"118","3","user","I must disagree with the two assessments above. Firstly the unit of land called a \""barony\"" has not been aboloshed. The barons, in the Republic of Ireland, are gone and have no place. Their titles are now purely honorific. The baronies on the other hand, still retain legal force, particularly in matters of probate and property rights. All old title deeds will usually refer to the barony. As you know, possession is nine tenths of the law. Why would you want to write off such a major fraction so glibly? Secondly, the contributions of Rashers have not been ignored. His erroneous assertions have been refuted - that's not the same thing as ignoring them. Furthermore, in the interests of peace, I proposed a sensible compromise that would reduce the header prominance of the barony while retaining the info elsewhere for those interested in pursuing it. I received no response to this proposal. It was for this reason that it was necessary to put the additional information elsewhere - the Reference section seemed most sensible. I have no objection to a new section of \""Notes\"" being added, though it appears a touch of overkill. Lastly, I have begun my work on the Baronies of Ireland. I invite your contributions to the article \""Eliogarty\"".","2024-02-27 16:56:00"
"118","4","assistant","Nothing I said has been 'refuted'. Such prominence in the lead is inappropriate and nothing more than a distraction. The arcane practice of retaining the names of these former administrative districts in title deeds has no legal bearing where land boundaries are now accurately surveyed. The precise limits of the baronies are largely unknown due to movement of stream courses, ditches and other long-gone physical features. They are of some historical interest, and their study can shed light on the development of civil and ecclesiastical parishes and as a possible reference to older ownership, but lets not get carried away.","2024-02-27 17:28:00"
"118","5","user","I was not aware of a wider dispute - maybe we should choose a more central location for our discussion, perhaps ? Anyway, I don't think such details as the chief towns of neighbouring baronies add anything of value to a village's article, be it within the article proper or as a note. Similarly, the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 probably needn't be mentioned in every village article. Linking both to and to the village's own barony should be sufficient.","2024-02-27 18:21:00"
